Why is data structures and algorithms important?

As a software developer our responsibility is to perform operations on data.
Basically we have to take data as input --> process it --> and use the processed data as input.

Input can be in any format ..... e.g. Google Maps take Starting and ending location as input, by using graph algorithm and dataset gmap helps us find the shortest path.
