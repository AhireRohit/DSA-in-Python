Recursive thinking is very important in programming and it helps you break down big problems into smaller ones and easier to use.

For iteration recursive codes are easy to write.

Iteration and recursion are different.
Sometimes iteration is used over recursion. Depending which method helps in faster programming.If program can be divided then recursion.


If problem statement starts with following statements then it is recursion:-
    - If you can divide the problem into smaller subparts
    - Design an algorithm to compute nth.....
    - Write code to list the n.....
    - Implement a method to compute all.....    

The prominent usage of recursion in data structures like trees and graphs
Whenever we are using graph recurssion becomes almost mandatory.

It is used in many algorithms like divide and conquer, Greedy and Dynamic algorithms.
