One - dimensional --> [1, 2, 3]                                                        

Two - dimensional --> Number of rows is more than 1 --> [1, 2, 3
                                                       4, 5, 6
                                                       7, 8, 9]
                                                       to access elements 2 dimensions are given

                                                    
Three - dimensional --> It's like a cube --> to access elements 3 dimensions are given
