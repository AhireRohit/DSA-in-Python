Type of algorithm are:
    Simple recursive algorithm
    Divide and conquer algorithm
    Dynamic programming algorithm
    Greedy algorithm
    Brute force algorithm
    Randomized algorithm


1. Simple recursive algorithm --> works as iterative algorithm
2. Divide and conquer --> it works in 2 steps : firstly problem divided into smaller problems and solved recursively : 
                          secondly combine the solution to the subproblems into the original problem
                          e.g. QUICK SORT & MERGE SORT
3. Dynamic programming algorithm --> it works on memorization and helps to find the best solution
4. Greedy algorithm --> We take the best we can without worrying about the future consequence.
                        We hope that choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution.
5. Brute force algorithm --> It tries all the possibilities until the satisfactory  solution is found
6. Randomized algorithm --> Use a random number atleast once during the  computation to make a decision.
