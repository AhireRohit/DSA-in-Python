Recursion --> A way of solving problems by having a function call itself.

The technique for making the problem smaller and smaller is called Recursion.

Properties:-
    Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
    In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller. This makes it easier to find the solution in the end.
    Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur. We will stop the recursion because we either found the answer or the answer does not exist.
