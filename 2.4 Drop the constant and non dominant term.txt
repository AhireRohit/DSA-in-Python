we can convert this into this :-
    O(2N) --> O(N)
    O(N^2 + N) --> O(N^2)

    and many more e.g. 

It is possible that O(N) code is faster than O(1) code for specific inputs.
Different computers with different architectures have different constants.
Faster computers will have faster memory access with LOWER CONSTANT.
SLOWER computers will have SLOWER memory access with HIGHER CONSTANT.
