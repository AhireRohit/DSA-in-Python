At the beginning of the linked list.
After a node in the middle of linked list.
At the end of the linked list.

When adding node in middle or end we have to do traversing first.

Suppose we need to add 3 after 2 in list of [1, 2, 4, 5] we need to traverse from 0 to 2 then add 3.
Suppose we need to add 6 at the end of the list of [1, 2, 4, 5] we need to traverse from 0 to 5 then add 6.
