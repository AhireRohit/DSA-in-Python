Data structures are different ways of organizing data on computer that can be used effectively.

e.g If there is collection of many books on the floor and we have to find any one specific then we have to go through all the collection.
But data structures help us organize them to efficiently find the books. 

Same works for softwares as well. Before processing the data , the data has to be organized in a way to make the operations efficient.
The efficiency of software depends on how he data is stored, organized and grouped during programming process.
